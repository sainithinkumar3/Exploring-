# KNN Implementation  with iris data set
### I will be doing 

Find euclidean distances from target(unlabled iris record) to all respective labled iris records

and then will be finding( by sorting the distances)the few respective nearest neighbour and 

then will be picking the majority basis lable from those labled neighbour records to project same as lable for the
target(unlabled iris record)
